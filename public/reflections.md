# End-of-Quarter Reflections !!!
## Franco Mateo A. Jacinto, 9 - Cesium 2029, Cs-14

#   Item No. 1
*"List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well."* 

1. **If-Else Statements**
    - These statements run on the same logic as what we used in Python and C++. They are all but engraved in my memory at this point.

2. **Switch Statements**
    - These statements also run on a similar logic as C++. I have already reviewed this topic multiple times.

3. **Loops**
    - These also use a similar logic as C++ and Python. These have been used and reviewed extensively.

4. **Premade Numerical Functions**
    - This was a new topic, but we have used it enough times for me to know it well. It is very common to use in a code to filter out non-numeric inputs.

5. **Markdown**
    - While also technically being a new topic, I was familiar with the formatting system because it was the same system that Discord uses, which I have been a user of for 5 years at this point. I have unknowingly used it, or rather its formatting, for years.

#   Item No. 2
*List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discusson and why*

1. **Ternary Operators**
    - I wasn't paying attention during the lecture. Additionally, there wasn't an incentive for me to learn and use, since an if-else statement could do what it does, albeit a bit longer.

2. **Functions**
    - Though I am familiar with how to use functions, I still occasionally forget things like parameters and returning a vlue. This has been a thing since C++.

3. **HTML I-O**
    - I never really entirely understood how they work, such as buttons and input tags. I mostly got them from photos of examples from discussion and KHub. 

4. **HTML Tags**
    - HTML was always quite confusing for me. Like HTML I-O, I mostly referred to photos and KHub.

5. **Continue**
    - Similar to ternary operators, I never really used continue in my code, and thus never fully grasped how it works. I didn't really see a use for it, and never really learned it.

#   Item No. 3
*Describe your plan of action to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item*

- I find that, like Math, the best way to study CS is to practice. Practice coding apps and incorporating a certain topic I find difficult. Additionally, I often refer to websites such as GeeksforGeeks in case I cannot figure out a certain topic.

#   Item No. 4
*In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think weren't effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?*

- The two most effective topics, for me, were graded exercises. Be it in-person activities or take-home tasks, I find these most effective when it comes to understanding our lessons.

- As for the two least effective, I find lectures and Kahoots the least effective. I prefer online resources over lectures since you can refer to them multiple times, and learn at your own pace. As for Kahoots, they're better as review tools than to learn.
