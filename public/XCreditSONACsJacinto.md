## *Interesting Key Points* 
- Major PhilHealth coverage expansions
- Expansions on Public Transport (e.g. Love Bus, Bataan-Cavite Bridge)
- Intramurals for ALL public schools
Personally, I find the 2nd step in particular a step in the correct direction. The 3rd is a bit interesting, though I like the idea- an emphasis on physical wellbeing.

## *Points I find weird*
- Intramurals for ALL public schools
- Free Wifi & Load for schools

## *Reflection*
After watching the SONA, I feel quite hopeful for the Philippines. Though some issues weren't mentioned, particularly POGO and the impeachment, I still feel that we are heading in the right direction. I think the choice to remove the red carpet in honor of the victims of the recent typhoons was a bit much- I think implementing & enforcing a rule of "nothing too flashy" (because some congressmen/women in the past were using the red carpet of SONA like a fashion show) and a word on the lives lost would have sufficed. 

In terms of points mentioned, I like how Health & Education are quite prioritized. The Cancer Assistance Fund will be of great help to the individuals battling cancer and their families. As of now, cancer medication is still obscenely expensive in the Philippines, with most options being experimental/not publically approved yet. Additionally, I find the introduction of public track & field ovals a bit much. A better solution, in my opinion, would be to improve walkability in cities, particularly in Metro Manila. Give people the option to walk or bike SAFELY, they will walk or bike. Manila is a dense city, so with the right planning/setup, this could be achievable as a norm, negating the absolute necessity for cars (keep them an option though). The ovals might be better suited to those who are particularly in T&F. 

## *1 word for the Philippines:*
Hope.
